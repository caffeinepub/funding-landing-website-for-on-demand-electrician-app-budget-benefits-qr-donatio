# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fully redesign the single-page landing experience with a futuristic, professional look on a white background, using a single consistent blue accent and subtle ambient motion—while keeping existing content meaning and anchor navigation intact.

**Planned changes:**
- Redesign the overall landing page layout and each core section’s visual structure (Hero, Donation, About, Budget, Benefits, Footer) while keeping it a single long scrolling page.
- Preserve and keep usable the existing section anchor IDs for navigation: #home, #about, #budget, #benefits, #donate (smooth scrolling remains).
- Apply a site-wide white background (light mode) with subtle overlays only (no heavy tinted section fills), maintaining a cohesive futuristic/professional style.
- Constrain accents to one consistent shade of blue for primary actions, links, highlights, icons, and interactive states; avoid introducing new accent hues.
- Add 2–3 subtle ambient motion/3D-style effects (e.g., gentle floating shapes, animated sheen/gradient, hover micro-interactions) with reduced-motion support.
- Update the sticky top navigation styling to match the redesign (including glassmorphism treatment on scroll) while preserving desktop/mobile behavior and the Donate/Support CTA scroll-to-#donate behavior.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see a newly redesigned, futuristic white-and-blue single-page landing site with subtle motion, and can still use the top navigation to smoothly scroll to the same sections via the existing anchors.
