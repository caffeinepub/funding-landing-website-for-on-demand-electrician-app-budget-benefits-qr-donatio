  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented by updating `frontend/src/redeployMarker.ts` with a new ISO timestamp and incremented buildId (v11). REQ-2 is partially addressed in code by logging the marker from `frontend/src/App.tsx`, but the actual production publish/verification step cannot be confirmed from the diff summary. Additional unrequested documentation/summary file changes are present.",

      "requirement": "Publish the latest build to production and verify the deployment updated by checking the browser console log line emitted from `frontend/src/App.tsx` matches the new `REDEPLOY_MARKER` values.",
      "reason": "The diff shows the log line implementation in `frontend/src/App.tsx`, but does not provide evidence of an actual production deployment occurring or of a verified console output from the deployed site matching the new marker values.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly states no new product features or UI/UX changes beyond what is required to force redeploy and verify the live build; modifying a summary file describing redesigns is not requested and suggests scope creep (even if only in documentation).",
