  "summary": "The diff largely implements the requested single-page landing redesign with preserved anchors, white background, glassmorphism nav-on-scroll, and multiple ambient motion elements with reduced-motion handling. However, it violates an explicit constraint by modifying an immutable file path, and the “single consistent blue accent only” requirement appears not fully enforced due to non-blue accent colors being introduced/kept in theme tokens and ambient effects.",
